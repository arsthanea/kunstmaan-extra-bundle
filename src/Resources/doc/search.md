# Search improvements

**Those features are in a transitional state and the goal is to integrate them with the KunstmaanBundlesCMS library.**

## Elastic configuration

You may fine-tune the ElasticSearch backend:

```yam
# app/config/config.yml

kunstmaan_extra:
    search:
        url: "https://user:password@localhost:9200/"
        replicas: 1
        shards: 4
```

## Chain Search Provider

The existing search provider does not iterate over all of itâ€™s providers and instead only uses the default one.
This component changes that allowing you to have multiple search backends.

For example using the [SyzygyPL/KunstmaanAlgoliaBundle](https://github.com/syzygypl/kunstmaan-algolia-bundle)

## Canceling node indexing

You may have a page that is indexed, but only under some conditions. Use the event:

 * `NodeTranslationEvent::NODE_TRANSLATION_INDEX_BEFORE` 
 
To cancel the indexation of any given `nodeTranslation`
